    <p>My name is Callum, I am a designer who loves rock climbing, video games, and the outdoors!</p>
    <h2>My Goals</h2>
        <p>I want to be a designer! <br> Originaly designing games was my goal but with the games industry being too hard to hold down a job in as a junior, and my realization that other design fields are an option, I'm now expanding my skillset in UIUX! I'm excited for the future to see where my path takes me, whether I become a UX designer or if I land a game design position somewhere, who knows! <br> My <a href="#history">history</a> as a game designer is very transferable to UX so I have high hopes.</p>
        <br>
    <h2>My Passions</h2>
        <p>I love designing with the user first, providing accessible experiences is something I take pride in! I also am passionatte about nature, I love going on hikes and climbing in the summer, and I care deeply about the protection of the natural beauty of the world!</p>
        <br>
    <h2>My Hobbies</h2>
        <p>I love to design and play games. Growing up I was always a gamer, and loved playing with my friends. <br>I also love to rock climb, which includes both gym climbing and outdoor climbing!</p>
        <br>
    <h2>My Pet</h2>
        <p>I have a dog who is super cute and deviously smart</p>
        <br>
    <h2>My Fav Food</H2>
        <p>I love sushi and Indian food, it's a tie for those two. They're both too good!</p>
        <br>
    <h2>My <a name="history">History</a></h2>
        <p>I grew up in BC, in the city of Maple Ridge. After high school I went to Vancouver Film School for game design, then landed an 18 month gameplay design contract after I graduated! When my contract ended however the games industry took a turn for the worst, with thousands of layoffs and maany studio closures, making it challenging to find work. After a year and a half of portfolio work, side jobs and job applications I decided to pursue UX design at BCIT!</p>
